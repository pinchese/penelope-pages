                    hi! i'm penelope, as you know, and i'm a musician.
                    the very first time i remember making music on a computer was
                    probably around 2014, when i used the fl studio 11 demo.
                    i remember my mom being very impressed with what i made,
                    despite it being only made of samples from the demo's library, lol
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    i think i gave up after a bit to focus on other things like programming, and
                    game development, which is something i'm still trying to learn today!
                    but in 2018, i got into music production again, and i heard about this cool, 
                    free program called <a href="https://lmms.io/" title="free, open source daw!" target="_blank">lmms</a>
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    well, i say heard about, i more <i>found</i> it, when i used someone else's
                    computer, which ran a version of linux called <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/" target="_blank">ubuntu studio</a>, which, i guess
                    may have started my current love for free, open-source software. if you're
                    into any creative work at all, and wanna try linux, maybe try ubuntu studio!
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    here i am now, using linux as my daily driver, <s>i use arch btw</s>, 
                    specifically <a href="https://endeavouros.com/" target="_blank">endeavouros</a>, with ableton running in wine
