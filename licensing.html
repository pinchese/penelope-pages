            <h2>am i free to use your music?</h2>
            <p>
                yes! you're absolutely free to use my music however,
                and in whatever you want,
                i don't really care. <br>
                this means remixes, using my music in sets,
                in media, stuff like that. <br>
                i'd prefer to be asked for permission first.
            </p>

            <h2>do i have to credit you?</h2>
            <p>
                it'd technically be illegal if you didn't,
                since my music's licensed
                under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 3</a> license. <br>
                though, if you decide not to, i can't really
                do anything about it besides ask nicely for you to give
                credit, heh
            </p>
            
            <h2>do i have to pay to use your music?</h2>
            <p>
                nah, i don't have a way of receiving money yet anyway. <br>
                my music will always be free to listen to and download though,
                but i'd love donations once i get that set up! <br>
                ps, you can distribute my music however you'd like, long as it's free.
                just make sure you let them know who made it!
            </p>

            <h2>can i make money off your music?</h2>
            <p>
                you can use my music commercially,
                but don't upload my music and sell it as "yours."
            </p>

            <h2>is there anything else i should do?</h2>
            <p>
                any remixes, or any other derivative work based on my music
                should be licensed under the same <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 3</a> license as the
                original music i made. if you have any questions about these terms, feel free to shoot me an email at pinchese@pm.me
            </p>
